Idea behind the project:

During the weekend I run a DND sessions with my friends. After the first couple of sessions I found that it was hard to keep up with combat encounters during the session. Keeping track of the enemies health, all of their abilities, and other stats like speed was hard. Often times I would be split between the monster manual which has monster information and a piece of paper that I would manually update when a monsters health went down. I created this program to centralize information and make my sessions easier to run. I also wanted to do a project over Christmas break to keep me entertained.
