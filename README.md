Idea behind the project:

During the weekend I run a DND sessions with my friends. After the first couple of sessions I found that it was hard to keep up with combat encounters during the session. Keeping track of the enemies health, all of their abilities, and other stats like speed was hard. Often times I would be split between the monster manual which has monster information and a piece of paper that I would manually update when a monsters health went down. I created this program to centralize information and make my sessions easier to run. I also wanted to do a project over Christmas break to keep me entertained.

This section of the program allows you to add Locations, Encounters, and Pieces. 

Lets use the example of a dungeon. The dungeon itself would be the location. The rooms in the dungeon would each be seperate encounters. The encounters would be made up of both Enemies and Player Characters repersented by Pieces.



Picking a location:

By Clicking on the "Battle" tab you get to a screen that shows all possible locations. If you click on one you will see the encounters available for that location.



Picking an Encounter:

After Clicking on a location you will see all of its encounters. By clicking on a encounter you will be able to see the characters in that encounter. 



Finally! The Battle Menu.

In this section you will be able to see relevant information like a characters name, hp, armor class, and intiative. 

Initiative: 
Each enemies intiative is rolled based on their statblock prior to combat. Players still roll their initiative which you can update using the scroll bar on the right. After intiative is updated the "Get Combat Order" button will sort all characters in order of intitative from top to bottom. 

Health: 
You can change the health of a piece by using the "Take Damage" scroll bar on the right side. A positive input will damage a character and a negative input will heal them. 

Additional Info:
Since DND is a very complex game it can help to just have a blank canvas to keep notes on the different characters. This is the main point of the additional info section. 



View Character Info:

When you Click on the "View Character Info button you will get a dialog box which show's you the characters information". The most important thing about this tab is that it keeps track of an enemies attack's and reactions. Many enemies in DND have upwards of 2 actions and reactions at higher levels which make's their information hard to rememeber. This pop up has saved me lots of time because I don't have to flip into the book constantly.
